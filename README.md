# PhysX Ball
## By Michael Law
### For CMPM 120 Demo 3

# How to play:
Click [here](https://mlaw2.github.io/PhysX-Ball/) to go to the game.
The game uses keyboard controls: Arrow Keys and Spacebar

# Assignment Requirements
## Inputs
I use discrete inputs for the arrow key inputs  
Spacebar uses continuous inputs  

## Physical Goals
The player has to try to align their red ball to touch a smaller green ball.  
The controls are set as such that minute adjustments are possible, but costs stats.

## Gameplay Scenes
I have a level template for initializing the player and goals for the game  
It also intializes the statistics tracking, which is displayed after a level completion in a Summary screen.

# Assets
I did not use any custom assets, everything was made with primitive shapes.

# Notes
There is a bug where the timer continues counting past each level
